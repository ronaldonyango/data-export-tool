        use the following command: <code>cd data-export-tool</code></li>
    <li><b>Install the dependencies</b>: The tool relies on certain dependencies to function properly. To install these 
        dependencies, use the following command: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> <br>This command will read the 
        <code>requirements.txt</code> file, which contains a list of all the required packages and their versions. It will 
        automatically download and install the necessary dependencies for the tool.<br>
        <b>Note</b>: Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system before running the above command.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   By following these steps, you can successfully install the Data Export and Scheduling Tool on your system. 
   Ensure that the installation process completes without any errors before proceeding to the next steps.
  </p>

  <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Discover how to effectively use the Data Export and Scheduling Tool. This section provides a step-by-step guide to 
    configure the tool, run it, and interact with its features.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Configure the database connection and preset queries</b>: Open the <code>core/db_functions.py</code> file and 
        configure the database connection settings according to your database setup. Additionally, you can define preset 
        queries or customize existing ones based on your requirements. This step ensures that the tool can access the 
        database and retrieve the necessary data for exporting.</li>
    <li><b>Add the following directories</b>: exports, logs, and resources. In the resources folder, you can add either 
        .txt or .sql files, with the required format of <code>table name</code> and <code>query</code>separated by a 
        comma.</li>
    <li><b>Run the tool</b>: Open your command-line interface and navigate to the project directory containing the Data 
        Export and Scheduling Tool. Use the following command to run the tool:<code>python main.py</code><br>
        This command will initiate the tool and display the user interface in the command-line interface.</li>
    <li>Follow the on-screen prompts to specify the export times, select tables/queries, and choose the export format.</li>
    <li>The tool will export the selected data to separate files and schedule the exports at the specified times. 
        The exported files will be stored in the specified export format (CSV, XLSX, or JSON).</li>
    <li><b>Automatic scheduled runs</b>: The tool will automatically execute the scheduled exports at the specified 
        times. It will continue running in the background, ensuring the timely execution of the scheduled tasks.</li>
    <li><b>Stopping the tool</b>: o stop the tool and halt the scheduled runs, press <strong>Ctrl + C</strong> in the 
        command-line interface. This will gracefully terminate the tool and prevent further scheduled exports.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="exporting-data">Exporting Data</h2>

        export tables 1, 3, and 5, enter <code>1,3,5</code>.</li>
    <li>Choose the export format by entering the corresponding number. Available formats: 1. CSV, 2. XLSX, 3. JSON.</li>
    <li>The tool will now export the selected tables/queries to separate files in the chosen format. Each table/query 
        will generate a separate file containing the exported data. </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="scheduling-runs">Scheduling Runs</h2>
  <p>
    Learn how to schedule recurring data exports with ease. This section guides you through the process of specifying export times, selecting tables/queries to schedule, choosing export formats, and running automated exports at the scheduled times.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>When prompted, enter the export times in <code>HH:MM</code> format. You can enter multiple export times,
        separated by commas. For example, to schedule exports at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM, enter <code>10:00,14:00</code>.</li>
    <li>Select the tables/queries you want to schedule. Enter the numbers of the tables/queries separated by commas.</li>
